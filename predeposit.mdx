## Overview

The Pre-Deposit Phase is the initial entry point into the Altura ecosystem.\
It allows users to deposit USDT before the Altura Vault launches and receive Nest Boxes, which award Nest Points.

During pre-deposits:

- Users lock USDT into Altura, gets preAVLT which can be later claimed for 1:1 AVLT (our vault shares)
- They immediately receive **Nest Boxes**, determined by their deposit amount.
- Opening a Nest Box grants **Nest Points**.

## Nest Boxes

Users earn Nest Boxes proportionally to the amount they deposit. Higher deposit tiers grant more Boxes and more efficient cost-per-Box rates.

| Deposit Amount (USDT) | Nest Boxes |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| \$199                 | 1          |
| \$499                 | 3          |

| \$4,999               | 40         |

Each Nest box earns you 1,000 to 50,000 points
