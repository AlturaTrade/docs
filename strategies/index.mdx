## **Portfolio Construction Overview**

The Altura Vault is built as a diversified, multi-venue strategy engine designed to generate stable, risk-adjusted returns across market regimes. The portfolio allocates capital across several uncorrelated strategy clusters, each contributing to consistent NAV growth while limiting directional exposure.

**Core Engine (Delta-Neutral) – 60–70%**\
This is the primary driver of stable returns. The vault runs market-neutral arbitrage structures that capture the spread between spot and perpetual markets, quarterly futures, and cross-venue funding-rate differentials. These strategies generate yield without taking directional market risk.

**Liquidity & Market-Making – 10–20%**\
A portion of the portfolio is deployed into liquidity provisioning and market-making opportunities. This includes providing liquidity to on-chain perpetual DEXs (e.g., GMX v2 HLP-style pools) and operating inventory-managed market-making strategies on centralized venues like Hyperliquid.

**Quant Overlays – 10–20%**\
These strategies apply quantitative filters to enhance returns and smooth volatility. Examples include volatility risk-premium harvesting, dynamic short-vol structures with protective hedges, and momentum-based trend overlays with strict risk budgeting to avoid outsized tail exposure.

**Perpetuals Vault Allocation – 10–25%**\
This sleeve allocates to curated perpetual vaults and external strategies that complement the main engine, providing additional yield sources while maintaining clear risk controls and monitoring.

Across all allocations, the vault aims to deliver a **net target return of 20–25% APY** after accounting for fees, slippage, execution costs, and hedging requirements.
