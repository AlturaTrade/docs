## **1. What is Altura?** 

Altura is a multi-strategy yield protocol deployed on **Hyperliquid**.\
 Users deposit USDT into a single vault, and Altura allocates capital across diversified, hedged, on-chain strategies designed to generate sustainable returns.

## **2. What networks does Altura support?**

Altura operates natively on **Hyperliquid**.\
 All deposits, withdrawals, strategy execution, and PPS updates occur on the Hyperliquid chain.

## **3. What assets can I deposit?**

Altura currently supports **USDT deposits** into its primary yield vault.

## **4. How does Altura generate yield?**

Altura uses three institutional-grade strategy pillars:

1. **Arbitrage & Funding Capture (~50%)**
2. **Staking & Restaking Yield (~30%)**
3. **Liquidity Provision & Market-Making (~20%)**

All strategies are hedged or neutralized, and all performance is verifiable on-chain.

## **5. How are yields reflected in my balance?**

Altura uses a **Price-Per-Share (PPS)** model.\
 As strategies generate yield, PPS increases.\
 Your share count remains constant — your value grows automatically.

## **6. How often does PPS update?**

PPS updates over time through an oracle with strict safety constraints:

- movement limits
- freshness checks
- timestamp validation
- authorized reporters only

All updates are on-chain.

## **7. How do withdrawals work?**

Withdrawals follow a dual-path system:

### **Instant Withdrawal**

Processed immediately if the requested amount ≤ vault liquid balance.

### **Epoch Withdrawal**

If the amount exceeds liquid funds, it enters the **current withdrawal epoch** and becomes claimable when the epoch concludes.

### **Minimum Claim Period**

Users must wait **6 hours** after depositing before they can claim a withdrawal.

Altura charges **no deposit or withdrawal fees**.

## **8. Is Altura a trading platform?**

No. Users do not trade, open positions, or manage strategies.\
 Altura is a **passive yield engine**, not an exchange or trading interface.

## **9. Can I verify Altura’s performance on-chain?**

Yes.\
 All strategies, balances, oracle updates, and vault accounting are fully visible on Hyperliquid.\
 Users can independently verify:

- PPS changes
- strategy activity
- vault liquidity
- share supply
- asset flows

Transparency is a core requirement of the protocol.

## **10. What risks should users be aware of?**

Risks include:

- smart contract vulnerability
- strategy underperformance
- oracle delays
- liquidity constraints
- counterparty risk from integrated protocols
- Hyperliquid network-level risk

Altura’s architecture minimizes but does not eliminate these risks.

## **11. Does Altura rely on emissions or inflationary APY?**

No.\
 Altura’s returns are derived **exclusively** from real economic activity not inflation, not printed tokens, not incentives.

## **12. Does Altura charge any fees?**

Altura does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees.\
 If performance fees are added in the future, they will be fully transparent and verifiable on-chain.

## **13. Who controls the protocol?**

Altura uses a three-role governance structure:

- **Guardian** - emergency pause authority
- **Operator** - oracle reporting & execution
- **Timelock Admin** - slow-moving configuration changes

No role can unilaterally move user funds.
