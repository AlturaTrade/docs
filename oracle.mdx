At the heart of the Altura Vault lies a simple promise: **users should always know exactly what their money is worth**.\
To deliver that transparency, we use a dedicated on-chain system called the **NAVOracle** - the mechanism responsible for calculating, validating, and publishing the vault’s **Net Asset Value (NAV)**.

While the underlying strategy engine is complex, the Oracle’s role is easy to understand:\
**it translates all portfolio activity into a single, trustworthy price per share.**

This article explains how the NAVOracle works in practice, without diving into technical details.

## **What Is NAV and Why Does It Matter?**

NAV (Net Asset Value) represents the **per-share value** of the vault.\
If the vault grows, NAV goes up.\
If markets move against the strategies, NAV adjusts accordingly.

Your AVLT tokens always reflect the latest NAV — this determines how many USDT you receive during withdrawals.

Think of NAV as the vault’s **real-time performance meter**.

## **How the Vault Tracks All Strategies**

The Altura Vault uses a diversified, multi-strategy portfolio that includes:

- Delta-neutral arbitrage structures
- Funding-rate capture
- Basis spreads (spot vs futures)
- Cross-venue funding differentials
- On-chain LP positions (GMX style)
- Market-making sleeves (Hyperliquid)
- Quant overlays and volatility strategies
- Allocations to partnered perpetual vaults

Each of these strategies generates profit (or loss) independently.

Behind the scenes, our monitoring system continuously tracks:

- Total deployed capital
- Unrealized PnL (“virtual” gains/losses)
- Realized profits from strategy cycles
- Fees, slippage, and hedging costs
- Any withdrawals or deposits entering the system
- Liquidity sitting idle or waiting to be deployed

This gives an accurate global view of what the vault’s assets are worth at any given moment.

## **How NAV Is Generated**

NAV is not guessed.\
**It is calculated from real data across every strategy venue.**

Here is the high-level workflow:

**Off-chain strategy monitor aggregates all positions**

Each venue (Hyperliquid, GMX-like LPs, basis trades, etc.) is tracked:

- Position sizes
- Entry and exit values
- Funding payments
- Inventory hedges
- LP payouts
- Unrealized gains or losses

These are compiled into a single total equity number.

**The total equity is compared with total AVLT supply**

This determines the fair value of each AVLT token.

Formula (simplified for users):

> **NAV per share = Total Vault Value ÷ Total Shares**

**NAVOracle publishes the updated NAV on-chain**

Only an authorized reporter (our off-chain NAV system) can publish updates.\
The Oracle enforces several safety checks:

- Is the update fresh?
- Is the value within a reasonable range?
- Did the guardian approve the update window?
- Is the reporter validated?

If everything is valid, the Oracle updates the **official price per share (PPS)**.

**The vault uses this NAV for all deposits and withdrawals**

- When you deposit, shares are minted based on NAV.
- When you withdraw, USDT is returned based on NAV.
- NAV always ensures fair, transparent, tamper-proof accounting.

## **Why Publish NAV On-Chain?**

Most investment platforms calculate performance off-chain.\
Altura Vault does it differently.

Publishing NAV on-chain guarantees:

**Full Transparency**

Anyone can verify the current NAV directly on the blockchain.

**Fair Pricing**

All users transact at the same NAV — no private pricing, no delays.

**Tamper Resistance**

Only authorized reporters can update NAV, and every update is logged permanently.

**User Protection**

The vault will not accept deposits or withdrawals if the NAV is outdated (stale).\
This prevents users from interacting with outdated or incorrect pricing.

## **Update Frequency**

The NAVOracle is designed to reflect the vault’s performance as closely as possible without overwhelming users with unnecessary noise.

- **NAV updates occur frequently** (typically minute-level granularity).
- A separate, less frequent process handles fee crystallization and resets the high-water mark.
- Users always interact with the most recent verified NAV.

This gives the vault both **precision** and **stability**.

## **How Users Benefit**

**✔ Transparent Value**

You always know exactly what your AVLT tokens are worth.

**✔ Fair Deposits**

Every deposit mints shares at the correct, up-to-date NAV.

**✔ Fair Withdrawals**

Instant or queued withdrawals use the same NAV, ensuring no user is advantaged over another.

**✔ Built-in Safety**

If the NAV data becomes outdated (e.g., network issues), deposits and withdrawals are automatically paused until a fresh update is published.
