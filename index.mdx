## **Overview**

Altura is a multi-strategy yield protocol deployed on HyperEVM.\
Users deposit USDT into a single vault, and Altura intelligently allocates capital across a diversified mix of on-chain and off-chain yield sources, including arbitrage, funding rate capture, staking yield, and liquidity provision.

Altura abstracts away all operational complexity—executing strategies across both on-chain environments and centralized/perpetual venues—while providing a secure, verifiable, and passive yield experience for depositors.

## **The Problem with Traditional Yield Platforms**

Many yield platforms rely on unsustainable models, including:

- inflationary token emissions
- circular incentive schemes
- directional speculation
- opaque strategy execution
- reliance on TVL growth rather than real revenue

These dynamics expose users to elevated risk, inconsistent performance, and unreliable returns.

## **Altura’s Solution**

Altura adopts a fundamentally different approach.\
All yield originates from **organic, economically grounded sources**, including:

- market inefficiencies
- funding payments
- protocol-level staking rewards
- trading fees
- RWA Markets

The system is hedged, diversified, transparent, and optimized for operational longevity.\
Users benefit from institutional-grade yield without needing trading expertise or strategy oversight.

# Principles of Sustainable Yield 

Altura adheres to strict standards for sourcing yield, ensuring that all returns originate from **real economic activity**, not emissions or speculative mechanisms.

### **Sustainable Yield Comes From:**

- **Market-driven fees** generated through trading volume
- **Funding rate payments** from hedged perpetual positions
- **Protocol-level revenue**, including staking and restaking rewards
- **Structural arbitrage opportunities**
- **on-chain, observable performance metrics**
- **Hedged or neutral positions** that minimize directional exposure
- **Institutional assets and funds** yield generated by businesses solving real world problems

### **Unsustainable Yield Comes From:**

- Inflationary **token emissions**
- **Circular incentive schemes** requiring constant new deposits
- High-leverage **looping strategies**
- **Speculative APYs** with no underlying revenue

Altura exclusively relies on yield sources that remain functional across different market regimes, supporting long-term stability and scalability.
