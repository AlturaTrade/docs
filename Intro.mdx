### What is Altura Trade?

Altura is a **yield protocol** that helps users earn returns from multiple on-chain strategies through one simple, safe vault.

Instead of choosing between dozens of complicated DeFi strategies, Altura bundles several proven, verifiable yield sources into a single system. You deposit USDT, and Altura works in the background to generate returns using real on-chain opportunities.

**_Altura earns returns from three different on-chain strategies, and the vault makes it easy for users to access all of them safely._**

### **Why people use Altura:** 

- It’s simple: one vault, three strategy types
- It’s transparent: all strategies can be verified on-chain
- It’s diversified: returns come from multiple independent sources
- It’s safer: avoids directional trading or speculation
- It’s passive: deposit once and let the system work

### **What makes Altura different:** 

- No “ponzinomics” or token emissions
- Yield comes from real fees, real staking rewards, and real arbitrage
- Strategies are fully hedged or neutralized
- Designed for stable, consistent performance
- Built with strong safety layers

**_Altura is built for both everyday users and serious DeFi participants who want safe, reliable yield without managing complex strategies themselves._**
