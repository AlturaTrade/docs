**AVLT** is the vault share token you receive when you deposit USDT into the Altura Vault. It represents your proportional ownership in the vault’s underlying strategy portfolio.

AVLT does not have a fixed price. Instead, its value grows as the vault’s **NAV (Net Asset Value)** increases over time. Your AVLT balance stays constant, but each token becomes worth more as the vault generates yield.

## Overview

**AVLT is not a stablecoin.**

When you deposit **USDT** into the **Altura Vault**, the protocol mints **AVLT** — your tokenized vault share representing ownership in the vault’s underlying assets. Each AVLT corresponds to a proportional claim on the vault’s USDT that is deployed across Altura’s autonomous on-chain yield strategies. When you withdraw, you return (burn) your AVLT, and the vault returns USDT based on the current **price per share**.

## Price per Share

The AVLT share price reflects the vault’s real-time performance:

- If strategies earn yield, AVLT’s value rises relative to USDT (e.g. 1 AVLT = 1.027 USDT).
- If strategies incur losses, AVLT’s value declines accordingly.
- If returns are neutral, AVLT’s value remains stable.

AVLT’s value is not pegged — it adjusts transparently with the vault’s on-chain performance.

## **Autonomous Vault Architecture**

The **Altura Vault** operates through an autonomous, fully on-chain allocation engine designed to optimize for sustainable, risk-adjusted performance. It only allocates into liquid DeFi pools and never borrows or loops positions, ensuring all assets remain fully collateralized and withdrawable at all times. All vault activity — holdings, yields, strategy allocations, and permissions — are verifiable directly on-chain and accessible from the Altura Vault dashboard.

**Permissionless and Transparent**

The Altura Vault is **non-custodial** and **permissionless**, granting users full control and visibility over their funds at all times. There are no intermediaries, no hidden pricing layers, and no centralized dependencies — everything runs transparently through smart contracts.

**No Peg. No Promises. Just Performance.**

AVLT doesn’t aim to maintain a fixed \$1 value. Its price evolves entirely based on Altura Vault’s net asset performance. Secondary market prices don’t impact depositors — you can always withdraw directly from the vault at the true on-chain share value, with zero slippage or price impact.

**AVLT = Transparent, on-chain yield — not a peg.**
