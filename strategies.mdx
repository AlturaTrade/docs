## Overview

Altura’s yield engine is built on three independent, economically grounded strategy pillars.\
 Each pillar contributes a distinct return profile and operates natively on **Hyperliquid**.\
 Together, they form a diversified, market-resilient system engineered for stable, sustainable returns.

## **Strategy Pillar 1 - Arbitrage & Funding Capture (≈ 50%)**

### **Description**

This pillar monetizes structural inefficiencies across perpetual futures and spot markets.\
 It operates entirely delta-neutral, removing price direction as a source of risk.

### **Yield Sources**

- Funding rate spreads
- Spot–perpetual price convergence (basis trades)
- Cross-venue arbitrage
- Perpetual market inefficiencies

### **Why It Works**

Perpetual markets naturally create funding payments to anchor prices.\
 Altura positions itself on the receiving side of these payments whenever possible.

## **Strategy Pillar 2 - Staking & Restaking Yield (≈ 30%)**

1. **Description**

   Capital is allocated into protocol-level yield sources that generate revenue from real usage, not emissions.

   ### **Yield Sources**
   - USDe staking
   - sDAI (MakerDAO savings rate)
   - Restaked LST collateral
   - Protocol-level revenue share mechanisms

   ### **Why It Works**

   These yields are driven by lending demand, staking economics, and protocol revenue — not inflation.
