## Overview

Altura’s yield engine is built on three independent, economically grounded strategy pillars.\
Each pillar contributes a distinct return profile and operates natively on **Hyperliquid**.\
Together, they form a diversified, market-resilient system engineered for stable, sustainable returns.

## **Strategy Pillar 1 - Arbitrage & Funding Capture (≈ 50%)**

### **Description**

This pillar monetizes structural inefficiencies across perpetual futures and spot markets.\
It operates entirely delta-neutral, removing price direction as a source of risk.

### **Yield Sources**

- Funding rate spreads
- Spot–perpetual price convergence (basis trades)
- Cross-venue arbitrage
- Perpetual market inefficiencies

### **Why It Works**

Perpetual markets naturally create funding payments to anchor prices.\
Altura positions itself on the receiving side of these payments whenever possible.

## **Strategy Pillar 2 - Staking & Restaking Yield (≈ 30%)**

### **Description**

Capital is allocated into protocol-level yield sources that generate revenue from real usage, not emissions.

### **Yield Sources**

- USDe staking
- sDAI (MakerDAO savings rate)
- Restaked LST collateral
- Protocol-level revenue share mechanisms

### **Why It Works**

These yields are driven by lending demand, staking economics, and protocol revenue — not inflation.

## **Strategy Pillar 3 - Structured Liquidity Provision (≈ 20%)**

### **Description**

Altura provides liquidity to revenue-generating ecosystems, primarily:

- Hyperliquid market-making environments
- GMX-style perpetual liquidity pools

Yield comes from real trading volume, fee capture, and structural spreads.

### **Why It Works**

Fee-based liquidity environments consistently reward capital that supports active markets — especially in high-volume venues.

## **Combined Strategy Architecture**

### **Summary**

These three pillars work together to produce:

- Uncorrelated yield streams
- Resistance to regime changes
- Sustainable returns backed by on-chain demand
- Consistent performance across market cycles

## **Why Altura’s Structure Is Sustainable**

### **Key Advantages**

- **No emissions:** All yield comes from actual economic activity.
- **Hedged exposure:** No directional bets; strategies are neutral or structurally offset.
- **Real on-chain demand:** Yield sources persist through Bull, Bear, and Chop markets.

**Diversification:** Different pillars outperform in different regimes.
