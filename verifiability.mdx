title: "On-Chain Verifiability"
description: "Transparent, auditable, and independently observable."
---

## Overview

Altura is built on HyperEVM, enabling full on-chain visibility into the vault’s performance, strategy execution, and accounting logic. Every component that impacts user value can be independently reviewed and verified.

---

## **Transparent Vault Accounting**

All vault operations occur on-chain, allowing users to verify:

- Total assets under management
- Total shares in circulation
- Price-per-share (PPS) changes over time
- Net asset value (NAV) movement
- Strategy allocations and rebalancing events

PPS reflects real, realized strategy performance and cannot be arbitrarily adjusted.

---

## **Strategy-Level Transparency**

While Altura abstracts complexity for users, all underlying strategy outputs are traceable on-chain, including:

- Funding rate capture results
- Arbitrage settlements
- Staking reward inflows
- Liquidity provision fee revenue

Each strategy contributes directly to PPS growth and can be verified by examining the vault’s balance changes and oracle updates.

---

## **Oracle Update Transparency**

PPS updates submitted by oracle reporters are:

- visible on-chain
- timestamped
- signed by authorized reporter addresses
- validated through protocol logic

Users can confirm that:

- PPS only increases when real yield is generated
- No future-dated or stale reports are accepted

Movement limits ensure fair and predictable updates

---

## **Withdrawal Queue Visibility**

All withdrawal activity is fully verifiable:

- Active withdrawal epochs
- User-specific withdrawal requests
- Liquidity availability
- Claim eligibility after the minimum holding period

Users can independently confirm their place in the epoch queue and the vault’s liquid balance before claiming.

---

## **No Off-Chain Yield Reliance, No Hidden Execution**

Altura does not rely on:

- off-chain trading
- manual operators executing strategies
- opaque yield sources
- centralized custody environments

All strategy execution and performance is settled on **Hyperliquid** or other integrated **on-chain venues**, enabling predictable, fully auditable outcomes. Where strategies involve off-chain components (e.g., RWAs), cashflows must **settle and reconcile on-chain** over the lifecycle of the position preserving institutional-grade oversight and transparency

---

## **Public Contract Addresses**

All core components are deployed as immutable or timelocked contracts, including:

- Vault contract
- Share token
- Oracle reporter
- Pausing and governance roles
- Strategy executors (where applicable)

This architecture ensures that users can independently track contract interactions and validate protocol behavior without relying on Altura-operated interfaces.
