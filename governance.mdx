title: "Governance & Protocol Roles"
description: "Institutional, precise, transparent"

## Overview

Altura is structured with a minimal and carefully separated role system to ensure operational safety, limited trust assumptions, and predictable governance. Each role has clearly defined permissions, enforced through on-chain access controls and timelocked actions.

---

## **Role Structure Overview**

Altura uses a three-tier role system:

- **Guardian** -Emergency authority
- **Operator** - Oracle reporter & routine execution
- **Timelock Admin** - Controlled configuration changes

Each role is isolated to prevent unilateral control or permission over critical functions.

### **Guardian Role (Emergency Controls)**

The Guardian is responsible for activating and deactivating the **paused state** of the protocol.

**Capabilities:**

- Pause the vault
- Unpause the vault
- Trigger emergency protections

**Limitations:**

- Cannot move funds
- Cannot modify strategies
- Cannot alter PPS
- Cannot change configuration parameters

**Purpose:**

To suspend activity during irregular behavior, oracle anomalies, or market instability.

### **Operator Role (Oracle & Routine Execution)**

The Operator executes routine tasks necessary to maintain accurate protocol performance.

**Capabilities:**

- Submit oracle price updates
- Trigger harvest or reporting cycles
- Perform non-value-moving administrative functions

**Limitations:**

- Cannot transfer assets
- Cannot pause/unpause the protocol
- Cannot modify core settings

**Purpose:**

To maintain accurate PPS updates and operational continuity.

### **Timelock Admin (Governance Layer)**

All configuration-level changes require execution through a **timelock contract**, creating transparency and predictable upgrade paths.

**Capabilities (after delay):**

- Update oracle reporter address
- Update guardian/role assignments
- Adjust configuration parameters
- Approve new strategy modules (future scaling)

**Limitations:**

- Cannot bypass the timelock
- Cannot execute immediate changes
- Cannot move user assets

**Purpose:**

Provide a controlled governance layer with built-in protection against rushed or opaque changes.

## **Governance Principles**

Altura adheres to strong governance standards:

- **Transparency:** All role actions and timelocked operations are visible on-chain.
- **Separation of Duties:** No single role can influence funds, PPS, or protocol safety alone.
- **Predictability:** Timelocked execution ensures changes cannot be introduced unexpectedly.

**Minimized Trust:** Fund movement is restricted to approved vault logic only.

## **Long-Term Governance Intent**

As the protocol matures, governance may transition toward:

- Multi-sig administration
- Community governance modules
- Institutional oversight frameworks
- Risk councils or strategy oversight committees

These transitions will follow conservative rollout processes to preserve protocol safety
