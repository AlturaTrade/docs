Altura’s architecture is designed to minimize risk, enforce transparency, and ensure that yield generation remains predictable, controlled, and secure. This section outlines the protections embedded across protocol operations.

## **Smart Contract Hardening**

Altura’s contracts incorporate multiple layers of reinforcement based on internal review and external audits. These include:

### **• Corrected Share Accounting**

Ensures that minting and burning of shares cannot be exploited through rounding or precision attacks.

### **• Slippage & Value Protection**

Deposit and withdrawal paths enforce value-consistency rules to guarantee users receive PPS-aligned outcomes.

### **• Oracle Validation Improvements**

All PPS updates are validated against upper/lower bounds, timestamp thresholds, and movement limits to prevent incorrect data propagation.

### **• Enforced Paused States**

All sensitive functions respect pausing controls, stopping execution during emergencies.

### **• Permissioned Transfers Only**

Assets can only be transferred to pre-approved smart contracts and keeper EOA’s, eliminating arbitrary fund movement risk.

### **• Secure ERC20 Allowance Handling**

Allowance operations follow strict patterns, preventing the class of errors commonly found in DeFi approvals.

These adjustments form part of Altura’s long-term hardening strategy to ensure systemic security.
