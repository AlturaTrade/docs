Depositing into the Vault allows users to convert their stablecoins (such as USDT) into AVLT vault shares. These shares represent proportional ownership of the Vault’s underlying strategy portfolio.

---

## Overview

The Vault uses a tokenized NAV model:

- Users deposit assets (USDT).
- The Vault calculates the number of shares to mint using the latest price per share (PPS).
- Shares represent proportional ownership of the vault assets.
- NAV updates come from the NavOracle contract.

## What Is a Deposit?

A deposit is when a user sends USDT into the Vault contract and receives AVLT shares in return. These shares:

- Represent ownership in the Vault
- Automatically reflect NAV growth
- Can be redeemed later for USDT

---

## Deposit Steps

1. Connect your wallet.
2. Enter the amount of USDT to deposit.
3. Approve USDT (only on first deposit).
4. Confirm the deposit transaction.
5. Receive AVLT tokens immediately.

Your share count remains constant, and your value grows through NAV updates.
