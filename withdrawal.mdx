Withdrawals allow users to convert their AVLT vault shares back into USDT.\
The Vault supports **two withdrawal modes**, depending on real-time liquidity conditions:

1. **Instant Redeem** — Same-transaction withdrawal when the vault has enough liquid USDT.
2. **Queued Redeem** — Withdrawal request is placed in a queue when instant liquidity is not available. Users claim funds later.

---

## Overview

When you withdraw AVLT shares, the vault returns USDT based on the latest NAV (price per share).\
Your shares are **burned**, and you receive USDT either:

- Immediately (Instant Redeem), or
- After the vault processes your queued request (Queued Redeem)

You are always withdrawing at fair value based on NAV.

---

# Instant Redeem (Normal Redeem)

If the vault currently holds enough liquid USDT to satisfy your withdrawal, the system performs an **Instant Redeem**.

### How It Works

1. You enter the amount of **AVLT shares** you want to redeem.
2. The app displays the **USDT amount** you will receive based on current NAV.
3. You confirm the transaction.
4. The vault immediately:
   - Burns your AVLT shares
   - Sends USDT to your wallet
   - Completes the withdrawal in a single transaction

### When Instant Redeem Is Available

Instant withdrawals occur when:

- The vault’s liquid balance ≥ the withdrawal amount
- No withdrawal cooldown or pause is active

---

# Queued Redeem (When Liquidity Is Low)

If the vault **does not have enough liquid USDT** at the moment of your withdrawal request, it automatically switches to **Queued Redeem**.

Your withdrawal is placed in a **withdrawal queue**, and funds become available to claim later.

### Why Queued Redeem Exists

The vault may have assets actively deployed in strategies or other venues.\
To maintain safety and ensure fair processing, large withdrawals or withdrawals during low liquidity periods must be **queued** until the vault updates liquidity or pulls funds back.

---

## How Queued Redeem Works

1. You initiate a withdrawal with the desired **AVLT share amount**.
2. The system detects insufficient instant liquidity.
3. Your request is placed into the withdrawal queue.
4. You receive a **request ID** representing your position in the queue.
5. Your AVLT shares are locked (you cannot transfer or reuse them).
6. The vault replenishes liquidity automatically or via periodic operator actions.
7. When your request becomes fully liquid, you can **claim** the USDT.

---

## Claiming a Queued Withdrawal

Once your withdrawal request is ready:

1. The UI shows it as **“Claimable”**.
2. You click **Claim**.
3. The vault:
   - Transfers USDT to your wallet
   - Completes your withdrawal
   - Unlocks your request slot
4. You now hold USDT again.

Claiming is a **separate transaction** from queue creation.

---

## When Queued Redeem Triggers Automatically

Queued withdrawal activates if:

- Instant liquidity \< required USDT
- Large withdrawals occur during active strategy allocation
- The vault is temporarily operating with reduced liquid reserves
- Safety conditions require queued processing

Users do not need to manually choose the queue.\
The system chooses the correct path automatically.

| Feature         | Instant Redeem          | Queued Redeem                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| When it occurs  | Liquidity is sufficient | Liquidity is insufficient                  |
| Completion time | Immediate               | Upto 24 hours, after liquidity replenishes |
| Share handling  | Burned instantly        | Locked until claim                         |
| USDT transfer   | Same transaction        | Claim transaction required                 |
| User action     | 1 transaction           | 2 transactions (queue → claim)             |
